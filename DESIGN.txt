Genre: 2D Scrolling Platformer
Name: "Sushi Survivor: Survival of the Sushiest"
Backstory: You've escaped! You are a brave piece of sushi who has escaped the clutches of the sushi
	 chef and your goal is to run across the table, avoiding knives and collecting more pieces of
	 shrimp to help you become the sushiest! If you get hit by a knife, that's the end for you.
	 Once you've made it past the table, you must face the threatening customer sitting at the end
	 of the table. Try to dodge their chopsticks and their attempts to slow you down with soy sauce
	 and survive with as many pieces of shrimp as you can left! You may try to deflect their
	 chopsticks by throwing your pieces of shrimp at them if you're in a dire situation. Good luck!
Goal: Survive with as many pieces of shrimp as possible; don't get hit by knives or chopsticks.
Basic mechanics: Use the arrow pad to move, use the space bar to throw.
Levels: (1) Table level: collecting shrimp and avoiding death by knives, moving forward across the 
		table
	    (2) Customer level: Trying to avoid chopsticks and soy sauce coming from above, moving left 
	    and right. Getting hit by chopsticks will result in the loss of one piece of shrimp and 
	    getting hit by soy sauce will result in reduced speed.
